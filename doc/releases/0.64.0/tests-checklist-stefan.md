 - [ ] Keyboard Manager Editor
 - [ ] Color Picker (check the tooltips)
 - [ ] FancyZones Editor

 - [ ] Image Resizer
 - [ ] Shortcut Guide (Windows controls are localized)

## PowerRename
- [ ] Check if disable and enable of the module works.

- [ ] Check if `Appear only in extended context menu` works.
- [ ] Enable/disable autocomplete.

    - [ ] Exclude Folders/Files/Subfolder Items (could be selected several)
    - [ ] Item Name/Extension Only (one at the time)
    - [ ] Enumerate Items
    - [ ] Case Sensitive
    - [ ] Match All Occurrences. If checked, all matches of text in the `Search` field will be replaced with the Replace text. Otherwise, only the first instance of the `Search` for text in the file name will be replaced (left to right).
    * Use regular expressions
        - [ ] Search with an expression (e.g. `(.*).png`)
        - [ ] Replace with an expression (e.g. `foo_$1.png`)
        - [ ] Replace using file creation date and time (e.g. `$hh-$mm-$ss-$fff` `$DD_$MMMM_$YYYY`)
        - [ ] Turn on `Use Boost library` and test with Perl Regular Expression Syntax (e.g. `(?<=t)est`)
    * File list filters.
        - [ ] In the `preview` window uncheck some items to exclude them from renaming.
        - [ ] Click on the `Renamed` column to filter results.
        - [ ] Click on the `Original` column to cycle between checked and unchecked items.

   - [ ] Try to open FancyZones Editor directly from the install folder and verify it doesn't run and adds a message to the log saying it didn't run because of GPO.

   - [ ] Verify the module is enabled.
