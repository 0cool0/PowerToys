## Install tests
 * install a **previous version** on a clean machine (a clean machine doesn't have the `%localappdata%\Microsoft\PowerToys` folder)
 * open the Settings and for each module change at least one option
 * open the FancyZones editor and create two custom layouts:
    * a canvas layout with 2 zones, use unicode chars in the layout's name
    * one from grid template using 4 zones and splitting one zone
    * apply the custom canvas layout to the primary desktop
    * create a virtual desktop and apply the custom grid layout
    * if you have a second monitor apply different templates layouts for the primary desktop and for the second virtual desktop
 * install the new version (it will uninstall the old version and install the new version)
 - [ ] verify the settings are preserved and FancyZones configuration is still the same

## Functional tests

 Regressions:
 - [x] https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/1414#issuecomment-593529038
 - [x] https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/1524

## Localization
 Change the Winodws language to a language different than English. Then verify if the following screens change their language:
 - [x] System tray menu items
 - [x] Settings
 - [x] OOBE (What's new)
 - [x] Keyboard Manager Editor
 - [x] Color Picker (check the tooltips)
 - [x] FancyZones Editor
 - [x] Power Rename (new WinUI 3 may not be localized)
 - [x] PowerToys Run ("Start typing" string is localized, for example)
 - [x] Image Resizer
 - [x] Shortcut Guide (Windows controls are localized)
 - [x] File Explorer menu entries for Image Resizer and Power Rename

## General Settings

**Admin mode:**
 - [x] restart PT and verify it runs as user
 - [x] restart as admin and set "Always run as admin"
 - [x] restart PT and verify it  runs as admin
 * if it's not on, turn on "Run at startup"
 - [x] reboot the machine and verify PT runs as admin (it should not prompt the UAC dialog)
 * turn Always run as admin" off
 - [x] reboot the machine and verify it now runs as user

**Modules on/off:**
 - [x] turn off all the modules and verify all module are off
 - [x] restart PT and verify that all module are still off in the settings page and they are actually inactive
 - [x] turn on all the module, all module are now working
 - [x] restart PT and verify that all module are still on in the settings page and they are actually working

## Keyboard Manager

UI Validation:

  - [x] In Remap keys, add and remove rows to validate those buttons. While the blank rows are present, pressing the OK button should result in a warning dialog that some mappings are invalid.
  - [x] Using only the Type buttons, for both the remap windows, try adding keys/shortcuts in all the columns. The right-side column in both windows should accept both keys and shortcuts, while the left-side column will accept only keys or only shortcuts for Remap keys and Remap shortcuts respectively. Validate that the Hold Enter and Esc accessibility features work as expected.
  - [x] Using the drop downs try to add key to key, key to shortcut, shortcut to key and shortcut to shortcut remapping and ensure that you are able to select remapping both by using mouse and by keyboard navigation.
  - [x] Validate that remapping can be saved by pressing the OK button and re-opening the windows loads existing remapping.

Remapping Validation:

For all the remapping below, try pressing and releasing the remapped key/shortcut and pressing and holding it. Try different behaviors like releasing the modifier key before the action key and vice versa.
  - [x] Test key to key remapping
    - A->B
    - Ctrl->A
    - A->Ctrl
    - Win->B (make sure Start menu doesn't appear accidentally)
    - B->Win (make sure Start menu doesn't appear accidentally)
    - A->Disable
    - Win->Disable
  - [x] Test key to shortcut remapping
    - A->Ctrl+V
    - B->Win+A
  - [x] Test shortcut to shortcut remapping
    - Ctrl+A->Ctrl+V
    - Win+A->Ctrl+V
    - Ctrl+V->Win+A
    - Win+A->Win+F
  - [x] Test shortcut to key remapping
    - Ctrl+A->B
    - Ctrl+A->Win
    - Win+A->B
  * Test app-specific remaps
    - [x] Similar remaps to above with Edge (entered as `msedge`), VSCode (entered as `code`) and cmd. For cmd try admin and non-admin (requires PT to run as admin)
    - [x] Try some cases where focus is lost due to the shortcut. Example remapping to Alt+Tab or Alt+F4
  - [x] Test switching between remapping while holding down modifiers - Eg. Ctrl+D->Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E->Ctrl+V, hold Ctrl and press D followed by E. Should select all and paste over it in a text editor. Similar steps for Windows key shortcuts.

### Screen Ruler
 * Enable Screen Ruler. Then:
   - [x] Press the activation shortcut and verify the toolbar appears.
   - [x] Press the activation shortcut again and verify the toolbar disappears.
   - [x] Disable Screen Ruler and verify that the activation shortuct no longer activates the utility.
   - [x] Enable tScreen Ruler and press the activation shortcut and verify the toolbar appears.

   - [x] Use the Bounds utility to measure a zone by dragging with left-click. Verify right click dismisses the utility and that the measurement was copied into the clipboard.
   - [x] Use the Spacing utility to measure something and verify that left-click copies the measurement to the clipboard. Verify that right-click dismisses the utility.
   - [x] Use the Horizontal Spacing utility to measure something and verify that left-click copies the measurement to the clipboard. Verify that right-click dismisses the utility.
   - [x] Use the Vertical Spacing utility to measure something and verify that left-click copies the measurement to the clipboard. Verify that right-click dismisses the utility.
   - [x] While using a Spacing utility, verify that using the mouse scroll wheel will adjust pixel color tolerance while measuring.
 * In a multi-monitor setup with different dpis on each monitor:
   - [x] Verify that the utilities work well on each monitor, with continuous mode on and off.
   - [] Without any window opened and a solid color as your background, verify the horizontal spacing matches the monitor's pixel width.
 * Test the different settings and verify they are applied:
   - [x] Activation shortcut
   - [x] Continous mode
   - [x] Per color channel edge detection
   - [x] Pixel tolerance for edge detection
   - [x] Draw feet on cross
